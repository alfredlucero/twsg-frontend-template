# twsg-frontend-template

TypeScript/React/Redux(RTK/RTK Query)/GraphQL/Paste Twilio SendGrid Frontend Template

## Getting Started

Install everything with `npm ci`.

Start up locally with `npm run start`. You should be able to see the frontend loaded at `localhost:3000/`.

Start up storybook to see the components in isolation with `npm run storybook` running at `localhost:6008`.

Start up unit/integration tests with `npm run test`.

Start up Cypress E2E tests with `npm run cypress:open:local`. Make sure you have the example [backend repo](https://github.com/alfredlucero/graphql-api-template) running as well for these tests to pass.

## Try this demo with an example backend

Clone this example [backend repo](https://github.com/alfredlucero/graphql-api-template), follow the installation instructions, and start it up while pointing this frontend to this backend server also running in another terminal instance. Go to `localhost:3000/` and see the example query being used to render a table.
